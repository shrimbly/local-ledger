      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Setup Database with Prisma and SQLite",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Prisma SQLite setup task into 4 focused subtasks covering database configuration, schema definition, migration execution, and IPC communication setup between Main and Renderer processes.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves database setup, schema definition, and inter-process communication, which requires technical knowledge in multiple areas. The complexity comes from integrating Prisma with Electron's architecture and establishing proper communication channels."

      "taskTitle": "Implement CSV Import and Parsing",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the CSV import functionality into 4 subtasks covering file selection UI, parsing implementation, column mapping interface, and validation/storage logic.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves UI development, third-party library integration (Papaparse), and complex user interactions for column mapping. The validation logic and duplicate detection add significant complexity to ensure data integrity."
    },

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create Transaction View and Data Fetching",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the transaction view implementation into 3 subtasks focusing on UI component creation, data fetching logic, and sorting/pagination functionality.",
      "reasoning": "This task is moderately complex, involving UI development with shadcn components and IPC communication. The sorting and pagination features add some complexity, but the task builds on established patterns from previous tasks."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Category Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the category management implementation into 4 subtasks covering category CRUD operations, UI components for management, transaction assignment functionality, and batch operations.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines UI development with data management across both transactions and categories. The relationship between these entities and batch operations increases complexity, requiring careful state management."

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement State Management with Zustand",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Zustand state management implementation into 4 subtasks covering store setup, selector implementation, component refactoring, and optimization/persistence features.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing state management requires significant refactoring of existing components and careful consideration of data flow. The complexity comes from ensuring proper state synchronization across components while maintaining performance."

      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Basic Filtering and Unexpected Expense Flagging",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the filtering and expense flagging task into 3 subtasks covering date range filtering UI/logic, schema updates for unexpected expenses, and UI components for flagging transactions.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves schema updates and UI development but follows established patterns. The complexity is moderate as it builds on existing transaction management functionality with incremental features."

    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Rule-Based Categorization",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the rule-based categorization system into 5 subtasks covering schema updates, rule engine logic, rule creation UI, rule management interface, and integration with transaction import process.",
      "reasoning": "This task introduces a complex rule engine that requires sophisticated pattern matching and application logic. The integration with existing categorization systems and UI for rule management adds significant complexity."

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Basic Visualization with Recharts",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Split the visualization implementation into 3 subtasks covering chart component creation, data aggregation logic, and interactive filtering/styling features.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing visualizations requires understanding of the Recharts library and complex data aggregation. The interactive elements and responsive design add moderate complexity, though the task is well-contained."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Google Gemini API Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Google Gemini API integration into 4 subtasks covering secure API key management, API client implementation, category suggestion logic, and UI for displaying/confirming AI suggestions.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves secure credential management, external API integration, and complex AI-based categorization logic. The security requirements and error handling for API calls significantly increase complexity."
    },
