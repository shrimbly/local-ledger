    {
      "taskId": 1,
      "taskTitle": "Set up Prisma with SQLite Database",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Prisma SQLite database setup into logical implementation phases, focusing on installation, schema definition, connection management, and error handling",
      "reasoning": "This task involves database setup with moderate complexity. It requires technical knowledge of Prisma ORM and database concepts, but follows a standard implementation pattern. The singleton pattern and error handling add some complexity beyond basic setup."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement IPC Communication Layer",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the IPC communication layer implementation into logical components focusing on security, API definition, handler implementation, and error handling across main and renderer processes",
      "reasoning": "IPC implementation requires understanding Electron's process model and security considerations. Creating a robust communication layer with proper error handling and type definitions increases complexity. This forms a critical foundation for the application architecture."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Create Basic Application Layout",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the UI layout implementation into component structure, navigation system, and responsive design considerations using React and shadcn/ui",
      "reasoning": "This task involves standard React component creation with moderate complexity. Using shadcn/ui reduces implementation difficulty, but proper state management and responsive design still require careful planning and execution."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Implement CSV Import and Mapping",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the CSV import functionality into file handling, data parsing, mapping interface, validation, and transaction processing phases with clear separation of concerns",
      "reasoning": "This feature has high complexity due to multiple UI interactions, data validation requirements, and integration with both parsing libraries and IPC communication. The column mapping UI and duplicate detection add significant complexity beyond basic file imports."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Create Transaction Viewing and Filtering UI",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the transaction viewing UI into data fetching/display, filtering implementation, search functionality, and pagination with appropriate state management",
      "reasoning": "This task involves complex UI interactions with multiple filtering options, search, pagination, and data management. Implementing efficient data fetching and state management across these features requires careful planning and coordination."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Category Management",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide category management into CRUD operations interface, category assignment UI, batch operations, and persistence implementation with appropriate validation",
      "reasoning": "This feature requires multiple UI components and database operations. The batch assignment functionality and integration with transaction views add moderate complexity, though the underlying operations follow standard CRUD patterns."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Rule-Based Categorization",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down rule-based categorization into database schema updates, rule management UI, pattern matching engine, and integration with existing transaction processing",
      "reasoning": "This task involves both data modeling changes and algorithm implementation. The rule matching engine and priority/conflict resolution add significant complexity. Integration with existing transaction flows requires careful coordination."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Basic Spending Visualization",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide visualization implementation into data aggregation functions, chart component creation, and interactive features with responsive design considerations",
      "reasoning": "Implementing data visualizations requires both data processing logic and UI component creation. Using Recharts simplifies implementation, but proper data aggregation and ensuring responsive, interactive charts still presents moderate complexity."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Google Gemini Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the AI integration into secure credential management, API client implementation, prompt engineering, UI integration, and error handling with offline support",
      "reasoning": "This task involves security considerations, external API integration, and complex prompt engineering. Implementing secure API key storage and graceful degradation for offline use adds significant complexity beyond basic API calls."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Implement CSV Mapping Persistence",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide CSV mapping persistence into database schema updates, mapping management UI, and format detection/validation logic with clear separation of concerns",
      "reasoning": "This feature extends existing functionality with moderate complexity. The schema changes are straightforward, and the mapping management follows standard patterns, though format detection adds some algorithmic complexity."
