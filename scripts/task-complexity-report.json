      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Implement IPC Channels for Wizard Communication",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the IPC channel implementation task into subtasks covering each required channel, error handling strategy, payload structure documentation, and testing approach",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple IPC channels with proper error handling and documentation. It builds on task 1 and involves coordinating communication between main and renderer processes, which adds moderate complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Create Google Gemini API Integration for Category Suggestions",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Google Gemini API integration into subtasks covering API client setup, prompt engineering, batch processing logic, error handling and rate limiting, and response formatting",
      "reasoning": "This task involves external API integration with Google Gemini, requiring batch processing, prompt engineering, error handling, and rate limiting. These aspects combined with the need to format responses consistently make it significantly complex."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Wizard State Management in Renderer",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Zustand store implementation into subtasks covering state structure design, action implementations for different operations, optimization strategies, and integration with IPC channels",
      "reasoning": "Creating a Zustand store with multiple state elements and actions requires careful design. The complexity comes from managing various transaction states, optimizing for re-renders, and coordinating with IPC channels."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Category Selection Combobox",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the combobox implementation into subtasks covering component setup with shadcn/ui, search and filtering functionality, and keyboard navigation enhancements",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a searchable combobox with keyboard navigation and filtering requires attention to accessibility and performance. Using shadcn/ui provides some structure but still requires customization for this specific use case."
    },

      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Keyboard Navigation and Shortcuts",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the keyboard navigation implementation into subtasks covering key handler setup, focus management, visual indicators for shortcuts, and help panel implementation",
      "reasoning": "This task requires implementing multiple keyboard shortcuts and managing focus throughout the application. It involves coordination with existing components and careful attention to user experience and accessibility."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Batch Database Update Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 3,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the batch update functionality into subtasks covering transaction management, prepared statement implementation, and error handling with rollback logic",
      "reasoning": "This task involves database transaction management with prepared statements, requiring careful error handling and rollback logic. The complexity comes from ensuring data integrity during batch operations."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 10,
      "taskTitle": "Integrate Wizard Flow and Implement Save/Exit Logic",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the wizard flow integration into subtasks covering initial data loading, AI suggestion fetching, navigation implementation, save functionality, and exit handling with confirmation dialogs",
      "reasoning": "This is the most complex task as it integrates all previous components into a cohesive flow. It requires coordinating multiple asynchronous operations, managing state transitions, and ensuring a responsive UI throughout the entire wizard experience."
