# ShadCN UI in Electron Projects

## Installing Components
- **Always** use the standard syntax for adding components: `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`
- After installing components, **check and fix import paths** in the new component files
- Components should import from relative paths, not absolute paths

## Import Path Fixes
- **Change** `import { cn } from "src/lib/utils"` to `import { cn } from "../../lib/utils"`
- **Change** other component imports like `import { X } from "src/components/ui/x"` to `import { X } from "./x"`
- Never use absolute paths like `src/` in component imports

## Component Location
- All ShadCN UI components should be in `src/renderer/src/components/ui/`
- The main utils file should be in `src/renderer/src/lib/utils.ts`
- If components are added to the root level, move them to the correct location

## Common Issues
- If you see errors about missing modules, check import paths first
- Look for duplicate utility files (especially in root `/lib/utils.ts`)
- When new components reference other components, ensure those are installed first

## Example Component Addition Workflow
```bash
# 1. Add the component
npx shadcn@latest add dropdown-menu

# 2. Fix any import paths in the new file
# Change: import { cn } from "src/lib/utils"
# To: import { cn } from "../../lib/utils"
```
